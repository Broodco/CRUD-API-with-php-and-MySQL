# CRUD-API-with-php-and-MySQL

## What's this repository about?

Three steps : 
1. Create a Restful CRUD API with PHP and mySQL
2. Create a Single Page Web App with Vue.js
3. Use the API to communicate between the front-end and the back-end

This project is a first for me, so I welcome, as always, any criticism or advice.
